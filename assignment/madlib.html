        <p class="story1-line">A <span class="waggoner">Waggoner</span> was once driving a <span class="heavy">heavy</span> load along a very muddy way.</p>
        <p class="story1-line">At last he came to a part of the road where the wheels <span class="sank">sank</span> half-way into the mire, and the more the horses pulled, the deeper <span class="sank">sank</span> the wheels.</p>
        <p class="story1-line">So the <span class="waggoner">Waggoner</span> threw down his whip, and knelt down and prayed to <span class="hercules">Hercules</span> the <span class="strong">Strong</span>.</p>
        <p class="story1-line">"O <span class="hercules">Hercules</span>, help me in this my hour of distress," quoth he. </p>
        <p class="story1-line">But <span class="hercules">Hercules</span> appeared to him, and said:</p>
        <p class="story1-line">"Tut, man, don't sprawl there. Get up and put your shoulder to the wheel."</p>

        <p class="story2-line">It happened that a <span class="dog">Dog</span> had got a <span class="piece">piece</span> of <span class="meat">meat</span> and was carrying it home in his mouth to <span class="eat">eat</span> it in peace.</p>
        <p class="story2-line">Now on his way home he had to cross a plank lying across a <span class="running">running</span> brook.</p>
        <p class="story2-line">As he crossed, he looked down and saw his own shadow reflected in the water beneath.</p>
        <p class="story2-line">Thinking it was another <span class="dog">Dog</span> with another <span class="piece">piece</span> of <span class="meat">meat</span>, he made up his mind to have that also.</p>
        <p class="story2-line">So he made a snap at the shadow in the water, but as he opened his mouth the <span class="piece">piece</span> of <span class="meat">meat</span> fell out, dropped into the water and was never seen more.</p>
